@Dockerfile @compose.yaml create a deployment for kubernetes including pods for the server and mongodb database, read environment variables correctly

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you create Kubernetes deployment configurations for both the server and MongoDB database, translating the Docker Compose setup into Kubernetes manifests. I'll create separate files for deployments, services, and configuration.

First, let's create a ConfigMap and Secret to handle the environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-config
data:
  NODE_ENV: "production"
  MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: "${MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE}"
  PORT: "${PORT}"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  # Note: These values should be base64 encoded in production
  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: "${MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME}"
  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: "${MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD}"
  MONGO_URI: "${MONGO_URI}"
```

Now, let's create the MongoDB deployment and service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongodb
  labels:
    app: mongodb
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongodb
        image: mongo:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: health-dashboard-config
        - secretRef:
            name: health-dashboard-secrets
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mongodb-data
          mountPath: /data/db
        livenessProbe:
          exec:
            command:
            - mongosh
            - --eval
            - "db.adminCommand('ping')"
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
      volumes:
      - name: mongodb-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mongodb-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongodb
spec:
  selector:
    app: mongodb
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
      targetPort: 27017
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mongodb-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Finally, let's create the server deployment and service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-server
  labels:
    app: health-dashboard-server
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: health-dashboard-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: health-dashboard-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: health-dashboard-server:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Never  # For local development
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: health-dashboard-config
        - secretRef:
            name: health-dashboard-secrets
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 3000
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 3000
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 20
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-server
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer  # Change to ClusterIP if using an Ingress
  selector:
    app: health-dashboard-server
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
```

Let me explain the Kubernetes configurations I've created:

1. `k8s/config.yaml`:
   - Contains a ConfigMap for non-sensitive configuration
   - Contains a Secret for sensitive data (MongoDB credentials and URI)
   - Note: In production, you should base64 encode the secret values

2. `k8s/mongodb.yaml`:
   - Deployment for MongoDB with one replica
   - Persistent volume claim for data storage
   - Service to expose MongoDB internally
   - Health checks using MongoDB ping command
   - Environment variables from ConfigMap and Secrets

3. `k8s/server.yaml`:
   - Deployment for the Node.js server
   - LoadBalancer service to expose the application
   - Health and readiness probes
   - Environment variables from ConfigMap and Secrets

To deploy these configurations:

1. First, make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster running and `kubectl` configured.

2. Build and tag your server image:
```bash
docker build -t health-dashboard-server:latest -f server/Dockerfile .
```

3. Apply the configurations in order:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/config.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/mongodb.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/server.yaml
```

Important notes:
1. Before applying, replace the environment variable placeholders in `config.yaml` with actual values
2. The MongoDB data is persisted using a PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
3. The server is exposed via a LoadBalancer service (you can change this to ClusterIP if you're using an Ingress controller)
4. I've added health checks for both services
5. The server image is set to `imagePullPolicy: Never` assuming local development. For production, you should push the image to a container registry and update this policy

Would you like me to make any adjustments to these configurations or explain any part in more detail?

```shellscript
docker build -t health-dashboard-server:latest -f server/Dockerfile .
```

```shellscript
kubectl apply -f k8s/config.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/mongodb.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/server.yaml
```

**User**

how does the configmap work? can I hardcode my .env secrets in here and the deployment will be able to reference those secrets?

---

Let me explain ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes, and the best practices for handling environment variables and sensitive data.

**ConfigMaps and Secrets Overview:**

1. **ConfigMap**
- Used for non-sensitive configuration data
- Stored in plain text
- Should be used for things like:
  - `NODE_ENV`
  - API endpoints
  - Feature flags
  - Other non-sensitive configs

2. **Secrets**
- Used for sensitive data
- Base64 encoded (but not encrypted by default)
- Should be used for things like:
  - Database credentials
  - API keys
  - Authentication tokens
  - Other sensitive data

**Important Security Consideration:**
‚ùå You should NOT hardcode sensitive data directly in your Kubernetes manifests because:
1. The files might be committed to version control
2. The values would be visible to anyone with access to the cluster
3. It's considered a security anti-pattern

Here's how to properly handle this:

1. **Development Environment Example:**
```yaml
# k8s/config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:  # Using stringData allows you to write plain text that will be automatically encoded
  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: "dev_user"
  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: "dev_password"
  MONGO_URI: "mongodb://dev_user:dev_password@mongodb:27017/dev_db"
```

2. **Production Best Practices:**
Instead of hardcoding secrets, you should:

```bash
# 1. Create a secret from your .env file
kubectl create secret generic health-dashboard-secrets --from-env-file=.env

# 2. Or create individual secrets
kubectl create secret generic health-dashboard-secrets \
  --from-literal=MONGO_URI=mongodb://user:pass@host:27017/db \
  --from-literal=MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=user \
  --from-literal=MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass
```

3. **Even Better Production Practice:**
Use a secrets management solution like:
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- Google Cloud Secret Manager

Here's an example of how your deployment references these values:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-server
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        env:
        # Reference individual environment variables
        - name: MONGO_URI
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: health-dashboard-secrets
              key: MONGO_URI
        
        # Or mount all environment variables at once
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: health-dashboard-secrets
        - configMapRef:
            name: health-dashboard-config
```

**To test this out locally:**

1. Create a `.env` file:
```env
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=testuser
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=testpass
MONGO_URI=mongodb://testuser:testpass@mongodb:27017/testdb
MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=testdb
PORT=3000
```

2. Create the secret from your .env file:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic health-dashboard-secrets --from-env-file=.env
```

3. Verify the secret was created:
```bash
kubectl get secrets health-dashboard-secrets -o yaml
```

4. Your pods will now be able to access these environment variables.

**To check if it's working:**

```bash
# Get a shell in your server pod
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=health-dashboard-server -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- /bin/sh

# Inside the pod, check the environment variables
env | grep MONGO
```

Remember:
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use different secrets for different environments
- Consider using a secrets management solution for production
- Kubernetes secrets are only base64 encoded by default, not encrypted. For production, consider:
  - Enabling encryption at rest for your Kubernetes secrets
  - Using external secrets management solutions
  - Using Sealed Secrets or similar solutions for GitOps workflows

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail or show you how to set up a specific secrets management solution?

```yaml
# k8s/config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:  # Using stringData allows you to write plain text that will be automatically encoded
  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: "dev_user"
  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: "dev_password"
  MONGO_URI: "mongodb://dev_user:dev_password@mongodb:27017/dev_db"
```

```shellscript
# 1. Create a secret from your .env file
kubectl create secret generic health-dashboard-secrets --from-env-file=.env

# 2. Or create individual secrets
kubectl create secret generic health-dashboard-secrets \
  --from-literal=MONGO_URI=mongodb://user:pass@host:27017/db \
  --from-literal=MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=user \
  --from-literal=MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-server
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        env:
        # Reference individual environment variables
        - name: MONGO_URI
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: health-dashboard-secrets
              key: MONGO_URI
        
        # Or mount all environment variables at once
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: health-dashboard-secrets
        - configMapRef:
            name: health-dashboard-config
```

```plaintext
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=testuser
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=testpass
MONGO_URI=mongodb://testuser:testpass@mongodb:27017/testdb
MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=testdb
PORT=3000
```

```shellscript
kubectl create secret generic health-dashboard-secrets --from-env-file=.env
```

```shellscript
kubectl get secrets health-dashboard-secrets -o yaml
```

```shellscript
# Get a shell in your server pod
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=health-dashboard-server -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- /bin/sh

# Inside the pod, check the environment variables
env | grep MONGO
```

**User**

from within a mongo db database, is there anyway to get the connection uri?

---

**Cursor**

From within a MongoDB database, you can't directly get the full connection URI that was used to connect to it, as this is a client-side connection detail. However, you can get some components of the connection information. Let me show you a few commands that can help you gather connection-related information from within MongoDB:

1. To see the current connection details:
```javascript
db.serverStatus().connections
```

2. To see the host and port the server is running on:
```javascript
db.serverStatus().host
```

3. To see which database you're currently connected to:
```javascript
db.getName()
```

4. To see the current user:
```javascript
db.runCommand({connectionStatus: 1})
```

However, for security reasons, MongoDB doesn't expose the full connection URI including credentials from within the database itself. This is because:
1. The connection URI often contains sensitive information (username/password)
2. The URI is a client-side construct
3. Multiple different URIs could be used to connect to the same database

If you need to get the connection URI, you would need to:
1. Check your application's configuration files
2. Look at environment variables where the URI is stored
3. Check your deployment configuration (like the Kubernetes secrets we just discussed)

For example, in your case, based on your Docker Compose file, the MongoDB URI would be constructed using these environment variables:
- `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME`
- `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`
- The host would be `mongodb` (the service name)
- The port would be `27017`

The format would be:
```
mongodb://${MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME}:${MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD}@mongodb:27017/${MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE}
```

Is there a specific reason you're trying to get the connection URI? I might be able to suggest an alternative approach based on what you're trying to accomplish.

```javascript
db.serverStatus().connections
```

```javascript
db.serverStatus().host
```

```javascript
db.getName()
```

```javascript
db.runCommand({connectionStatus: 1})
```

```plaintext
mongodb://${MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME}:${MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD}@mongodb:27017/${MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE}
```

I am not able to authenticate to my mongo db even though I have verified that the pod is correctly loading the environment variables from the secrets. I was trying to authenticate through the `db.auth("mongo")` command while in the mongosh client. Here are the env variables currently loaded in the mongo pod: 

---

**Cursor**

Ah, I see the issue. When using MongoDB authentication, there are a few important things to understand:

1. The environment variables show that:
   - Username: `mongo`
   - Password: `mongo`
   - Database: `db`
   - Authentication Database: `admin` (from the `authSource=admin` in the URI)

The key thing here is that `db.auth()` needs to be run on the authentication database (in this case `admin`), not the regular database. Here's how to properly authenticate:

```javascript
// First switch to the admin database (this is where user credentials are stored)
use admin

// Then authenticate with both username and password
db.auth("mongo", "mongo")
```

Or you can do it in one line:
```javascript
db.getSiblingDB("admin").auth("mongo", "mongo")
```

After successful authentication, you can switch to your working database:
```javascript
use db
```

The reason this is necessary is because:
1. MongoDB stores user credentials in the `admin` database by default
2. The `authSource=admin` in your connection URI explicitly tells MongoDB to look for credentials in the `admin` database
3. Just running `db.auth("mongo")` without switching to the `admin` database first won't work because:
   - It's looking in the wrong database for credentials
   - It's missing the password parameter

You can verify your authentication status at any time with:
```javascript
db.runCommand({connectionStatus : 1})
```

Would you like me to explain more about MongoDB's authentication system or help troubleshoot if you're still having issues?

```javascript
// First switch to the admin database (this is where user credentials are stored)
use admin

// Then authenticate with both username and password
db.auth("mongo", "mongo")
```

```javascript
db.getSiblingDB("admin").auth("mongo", "mongo")
```

```javascript
use db
```

```javascript
db.runCommand({connectionStatus : 1})
```

Ok, I was now able to succesfully authenticate through mongosh, but my node app is still failing when trying to connect to my mongodb container, running in the same pod. the mongo uri I have in the app is "mongodb://mongo:mongo@mongodb:27017/db?authSource=admin", but I'm getting this error: @main.ts @DB.ts 

---

**Cursor**

I see the issue from the error message: `MongooseServerSelectionError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND mongodb`. This indicates a DNS resolution problem - your Node.js app cannot resolve the hostname "mongodb".

The problem is that your Node.js app and MongoDB container are not in the same pod (they're actually in different pods as per your Kubernetes deployment), so you need to use the proper Kubernetes DNS name to connect to the MongoDB service.

In Kubernetes, services are accessible via DNS names in the format: `service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local`. If both services are in the same namespace, you can just use the service name.

Let's check your MongoDB service name from your Kubernetes configuration:

1. From your earlier k8s configuration, the MongoDB service is named `mongodb`
2. The service is exposing port 27017

Your current MongoDB URI is:
```
mongodb://mongo:mongo@mongodb:27017/db?authSource=admin
```

This should actually work if both services are in the same namespace. Let's verify a few things:

1. Check if both pods are running and in the same namespace:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

2. Check if the MongoDB service is created correctly:
```bash
kubectl get svc mongodb
```

3. Try using the fully qualified DNS name in your MongoDB URI:
```
mongodb://mongo:mongo@mongodb.default.svc.cluster.local:27017/db?authSource=admin
```

4. You can also test the connection from within your server pod:
```bash
# Get into your server pod
kubectl exec -it deploy/health-dashboard-server -- /bin/sh

# Install netcat to test connection
apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat

# Test if you can reach MongoDB
nc -zv mongodb 27017
```

If you want to quickly verify if it's a DNS issue, you can temporarily modify your server deployment to use MongoDB's pod IP directly:

1. Get MongoDB pod IP:
```bash
kubectl get pod -l app=mongodb -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.podIP}'
```

2. Then temporarily try using that IP in your MongoDB URI:
```
mongodb://mongo:mongo@<pod-ip>:27017/db?authSource=admin
```

Would you like me to help you try any of these troubleshooting steps? Also, could you share the output of `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get svc` so I can better understand your current cluster state?

```plaintext
mongodb://mongo:mongo@mongodb:27017/db?authSource=admin
```

```shellscript
kubectl get pods
```

```shellscript
kubectl get svc mongodb
```

```plaintext
mongodb://mongo:mongo@mongodb.default.svc.cluster.local:27017/db?authSource=admin
```

```shellscript
# Get into your server pod
kubectl exec -it deploy/health-dashboard-server -- /bin/sh

# Install netcat to test connection
apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat

# Test if you can reach MongoDB
nc -zv mongodb 27017
```

```shellscript
kubectl get pod -l app=mongodb -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.podIP}'
```

```plaintext

Check my current deployment to see if it would work @deployment.yaml

I see several issues in your deployment configuration that are likely causing the connection problems:

1. **Most Critical Issue**: You're running MongoDB as a sidecar container in the same pod as your server. In this case, you should connect to MongoDB using `localhost` instead of `mongodb` since they're in the same pod. Your MongoDB URI should be:
```
mongodb://mongo:mongo@localhost:27017/db?authSource=admin
```

2. **Architectural Issues**:
- Running MongoDB as a sidecar means each server pod has its own MongoDB instance, which is not recommended because:
  - Data will not be synchronized between pods (you have 2 replicas)
  - Each pod will have its own MongoDB data
  - The PVC might have conflicts with multiple pods trying to write to it

3. **Service Configuration Issues**:
- You're exposing MongoDB through NodePort (port 27017), which is a security risk
- The service is trying to route both the server and MongoDB traffic through the same selector

Here's how I would fix this. Let's separate MongoDB into its own deployment:

```plaintext
mongodb://mongo:mongo@localhost:27017/db?authSource=admin
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongodb-deployment
  namespace: health-dashboard
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  replicas: 1  # MongoDB should typically have 1 replica in dev
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongodb
        image: mongo:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: health-dashboard-secrets
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mongodb-data
          mountPath: /data/db
        livenessProbe:
          exec:
            command:
            - mongosh
            - --eval
            - "db.adminCommand('ping')"
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
      volumes:
      - name: mongodb-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mongodb-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongodb
  namespace: health-dashboard
spec:
  selector:
    app: mongodb
  ports:
    - port: 27017
      targetPort: 27017
  type: ClusterIP  # Only accessible within the cluster
```

Now let's update the server deployment to remove the MongoDB sidecar:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-server-deployment
  namespace: health-dashboard
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: health-dashboard-server
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: health-dashboard-server
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: health-dashboard-server
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: health-dashboard-secrets
          image: health-dashboard-server:latest
          imagePullPolicy: Never
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 3000
            initialDelaySeconds: 15
            periodSeconds: 20
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: health-dashboard-server-service
  namespace: health-dashboard
spec:
  selector:
    app: health-dashboard-server
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
      nodePort: 30000
      name: "server-http"
```

Now your MongoDB URI in your application should be:
```
mongodb://mongo:mongo@mongodb.health-dashboard.svc.cluster.local:27017/db?authSource=admin
```

Or since you're in the same namespace, this will also work:
```
mongodb://mongo:mongo@mongodb:27017/db?authSource=admin
```

To apply these changes:

1. Delete the old deployment:
```bash
kubectl delete -f k8/dev/deployment.yaml
```

2. Apply the new configurations:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8/dev/mongodb.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8/dev/deployment.yaml
```

The key improvements in this setup:
1. MongoDB runs as a separate deployment with one replica
2. MongoDB is only accessible within the cluster (ClusterIP)
3. Server pods can all connect to the same MongoDB instance
4. PVC will work correctly as only one MongoDB pod will access it
5. Better security as MongoDB is not exposed via NodePort

Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
